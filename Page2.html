<h1>Combat</h1>
<p>In order to survive Hyrule you will need to learn to protect yourself. There are many different ways to protect yourself. You can keep range with a bow, you can get up close with a melee or you can chose to spam bombs at the enemy until they're dead. </p>
<p>If you chose the up close and personal route you will need to learn a few different things. One of the most useful would be flurry rush.</p>
<h1>Flurry Rush</h1>

<p>Flurry rush is when you perfectly time a dodge an attack and the world goes slow motion and you are allowed to get a few attacks in.</p>
<h1>Parry</h1>

<p>Parrying is very similar to getting the Flurry Attack in which it requires perfect timing but instead of melee attacks it's for ranged attacks</p>
